Herein, an origami chomper-based flexible gripper is designed using a combination of the origami technique and a newly developed nonlinear topology optimization method. This novel origami chomper-based flexible gripper exhibits superior gripping performance, as revealed by a series of experiments, including gripping range capability under an identical input load, maximum gripping ratio, gripping adaptability, and achieving richer gripping characteristics by size scaling. The origami chomper-based flexible gripper can handle a wide range of object irregularities in textures and uneven shapes and can enable effective gripping of objects across scales from millimeters to centimeters to decimeters through size scaling.

	abstract = {Inspired by the kirigami and recombination mechanism, a kirigami flexible gripper is presented. The configuration variation behaviors are realized by recombinant kirigami segments, and thus, with only head segment actuation, the gripper slickly deforms among different configurations. Revolutionizing the conventional deployable systems, the proposed design methodology can realize configuration variation‐locking integration, and reusing of multi‐stability property. To realize rapid configuration switching with the lowest energy input, a nested origami actuation, called trigger structure, is given. Furthermore, advanced design for the trigger structure is carried out, broadening the bistable state to four‐stable geometric configurations for enhanced reachable space of the flexible gripper. By combining the design of the advanced trigger structure, the flexible gripper enables an energy‐free switching behavior between deployed and curled configurations in symmetrical and asymmetrical planes. The asymmetrical configurations, induced by the multi‐stability property of the advanced trigger structure, make the flexible gripper appropriate for various moving velocities capture. The proposed kirigami multi‐stable flexible gripper has significant capture capability for moving targets with different types and motion attitudes. Summarily, the proposed kirigami multi‐stable flexible gripper opens a new avenue for flexible robots, with potential applications in space exploration, grippers, and beyond.

	volume = {77},

	abstract = {The design of walking-assistance exosuits is becoming increasingly popular among those who aim at developing a light, affordable and wearable system. They are indeed an alternative to traditional exoskeletons, which tend to be bulkier and more expensive. The main advantages of exosuits, as opposed to exoskeletons, are their lower weight and price, as well as their increased wearability and kinematic compatibility with the user. Thus, it is key to optimize their design and, particularly, the number of actuators and the actuation scheme. One of the current, common ways to achieve better designs, is to conduct a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on some of the involved variables to reduce their dimensionality and thus, simplify the actuation system. The goal of this paper is to analyze the different variables upon which PCA can be conducted and propose the resulting actuation schemes, comparing the results and determining the best design approach for the design of a synergy-based, gait-assistance exosuit. The study focuses on both postural and dynamic synergies to optimize their design. Here, both synergy types are reviewed from a design perspective, yielding different design criteria following a PCA-based study, each with their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Thus, the design of cable-driven exosuits is optimized via analysis of gait parameters related with its actuation, such as joint torque or cable extensions. Kinematics or postural synergies lead to a higher cumulative variance of the first principal component and the transmission system is simpler than the ones obtained through dynamic synergies.},

	abstract = {A soft robotic hand is a robotic end-effector that can pick and place objects with high flexibility to handle fragile objects and adapt to unstructured and irregular shapes. One promising approach to handling soft objects is combining the rigid structure of the tendon-driven robot hand with elastomeric or rubber elements. It is essential to elaborate the tendon-driven mechanisms either in the closed-loop or open-loop kinematic system o obtain proper behavior of the under-actuation robotic hand. More specifically, the functional representation of kinematic construction of related components like shafts, pulley, and tendons must be carefully considered. This paper presents a systematic review of some recent technological advances in the area of soft robotic grippers. To analyze the tendon-driven mechanism (TDM), the kinematic synthesis is performed in this paper using graph theory. After the displacement equations are generated, the input and output torque (forces) connections are further appropriately obtained. Finally, a proposed design is given for a soft 2 degree of freedom (DOF) robotic gripper through exploring the openhand Yale model T, which employs soft rubber as the connector to each rigid link.},

	abstract = {In deep ice-coring, as in many other disciplines, a winching system is involved in the overall operation of the drilling activities. The need to efficiently store the cable on the winch drum is well recognized, and the ‘orthocyclically wound’ approach is often used. This is accomplished by means of a ‘Lebus groove’, along with a level winding scheme of some description. The level wind is usually implemented in one of several ways using some mechanism to synchronize the position of the level wind with the point where the cable meets the winch drum. A novel method using a feedback control system is presented in this paper, introducing a virtually error-free approach to the surprisingly difficult task of level winding.},
