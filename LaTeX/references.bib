	abstract = {Flexible grippers with superior gripping capabilities are essential for carrying objects. Herein, an origami chomper-based flexible gripper is designed using a combination of the origami technique and a newly developed nonlinear topology optimization method. This novel origami chomper-based flexible gripper exhibits superior gripping performance, as revealed by a series of experiments, including gripping range capability under an identical input load, maximum gripping ratio, gripping adaptability, and achieving richer gripping characteristics by size scaling. The origami chomper-based flexible gripper can handle a wide range of object irregularities in textures and uneven shapes and can enable effective gripping of objects across scales from millimeters to centimeters to decimeters through size scaling. This study paves the way for innovative high-performance designs of flexible grippers.},

	abstract = {Inspired by the kirigami and recombination mechanism, a kirigami flexible gripper is presented. The configuration variation behaviors are realized by recombinant kirigami segments, and thus, with only head segment actuation, the gripper slickly deforms among different configurations. Revolutionizing the conventional deployable systems, the proposed design methodology can realize configuration variation‐locking integration, and reusing of multi‐stability property. To realize rapid configuration switching with the lowest energy input, a nested origami actuation, called trigger structure, is given. Furthermore, advanced design for the trigger structure is carried out, broadening the bistable state to four‐stable geometric configurations for enhanced reachable space of the flexible gripper. By combining the design of the advanced trigger structure, the flexible gripper enables an energy‐free switching behavior between deployed and curled configurations in symmetrical and asymmetrical planes. The asymmetrical configurations, induced by the multi‐stability property of the advanced trigger structure, make the flexible gripper appropriate for various moving velocities capture. The proposed kirigami multi‐stable flexible gripper has significant capture capability for moving targets with different types and motion attitudes. Summarily, the proposed kirigami multi‐stable flexible gripper opens a new avenue for flexible robots, with potential applications in space exploration, grippers, and beyond.
